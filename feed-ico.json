The team sent a document to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in which they claim that they have generated $850 million, so far. The SAFT backed ICO was aimed at major venture capital firms and other cryptocurrency whales. For putting money in early, these investors will receive discounts on the platform\u0026#8217;s GRAM tokens. The public token sale is set for March and the team anticipates it will raise another $600 million more. However, that number may grow after the immediate success of the Telegram pre-sale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ... \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\t\t\t\u003cdiv style\u003d\"font-family:\u0027Open Sans\u0027, sans-serif; margin: 0 auto; width: 100%;\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"https://cryptocurrencynews.com/icos/ico-news/telegram-ico-850-million/?utm_campaign\u003drss__ccn\" target\u003d\"_blank\" style\u003d\"color:#084ec3; font-weight:600; font-size:20px; transition:0.2s;\" onMouseOver\u003d\"this.style.cssText+\u003d\u0027;color:#042f77!important;\u0027\" onMouseOut\u003d\"this.style.cssText+\u003d\u0027;color:#084ec3!important;\u0027\"\u003eRead The Full Article On CryptoCurrencyNews.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003cdiv style\u003d\"margin:50px auto; text-align:center;\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"https://cryptocurrencynews.com/icos/ico-news/telegram-ico-850-million/?utm_campaign\u003drss__ccn\" target\u003d\"_blank\"  style\u003d\"display:inline-block;\"\u003e\u003cimg src\u003d\"http://cryptocurrencynews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/11/click-to-read-more.png\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003cdiv style\u003d\"margin:50px auto; text-align:center;\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"https://cryptocurrencynews.com/\" target\u003d\"_blank\" style\u003d\"cursor:pointer;display:inline-block;\"\u003e \u003cimg src\u003d\"https://cryptocurrencynews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/11/logo_CryptoCurrencyNews-min.png\" style\u003d\"max-width:395px; width:100%;\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003cdiv style\u003d\"text-align:center; font-size:14px;\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eGet latest \u003ca href\u003d\"https://cryptocurrencynews.com/\" target\u003d\"_blank\" style\u003d\"color:#084ec3; transition:0.2s;\" onMouseOver\u003d\"this.style.cssText+\u003d\u0027;color:#042f77!important;\u0027\" onMouseOut\u003d\"this.style.cssText+\u003d\u0027;color:#084ec3!important;\u0027\"\u003ecryptocurrency news\u003c/a\u003e on bitcoin, ethereum, initial coin offerings, ICOs, ethereum and all other cryptocurrencies.
