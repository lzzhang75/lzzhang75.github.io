The team sent a document to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in which they claim that they have generated $850 million, so far.

For putting money in early, these investors will receive discounts on the platform\u0026#8217;s GRAM tokens. The public token sale is set for March and the team anticipates it will raise another $600 million more.
