Access to a large volume of high quality information is essential to the maintenance of a “winning edge” in every market, but the lack of any semblance of “safety net” coupled with the bizarre world of multiple exchanges, arbitrage, ICOs, forks, airdrops, and with the transient nature of the sector as a whole, amplifies that need acutely. This leads to a paradox in which information is desperately needed but any attempt to find such information results in a deluge of information the filtering of which is impossible for all but the most brilliant of traders. Barring those savants, most traders quickly reach a point at which they can no longer process the torrent of data presented to them and therefore cannot make informed, fully rational, decisions. The ITT platform is poised to become the calm in the center of the storm, a beacon of knowledge and confidence for anyone overwhelmed by the sheer enormity of the crypto markets and their associated information (i.e. everyone).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel\u003d\"nofollow\" href\u003d\"https://news.bitcoin.com/pr-itt-here-to-discover-decipher-and-deliver-actionable-crypto-trading-alerts-for-all/\"\u003ePR: ITT – Here to Discover, Decipher and Deliver Actionable Crypto Trading Alerts for All\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel\u003d\"nofollow\" href\u003d\"https://news.bitcoin.com\"\u003eBitcoin News\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
