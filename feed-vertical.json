We recently underwent a token sale where we reached our $20m hardcap in only 89 hours. As we relaunch our website, we think now is an opportune time to outline the future of aXpire. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo give a high level background, we tend to think of our company as four quadrants, making up a greater whole. We are split between P2P vs. B2B and front end vs. back end. Right now, we have only one quadrant of the company fully built out and in use; Resolvr. This application represents our B2B back end product, responsible for spend management. We are building out a front end add-on, to handle RFPs, under the Resolvr name. Businesses will be able to put out RFPs in a standardized front end, with metric-driven filtering, and full back end spend management support. Our P2P products are built around the concept of a consumer version of our B2B software, a platform for exchange of services and a back end of spend analysis. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel\u003d\"nofollow\" href\u003d\"https://news.bitcoin.com/116336-2/\"\u003ePR: SaaS Company Axpire \u0026#8211; for a Better Future\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel\u003d\"nofollow\" href\u003d\"https://news.bitcoin.com\"\u003eBitcoin News\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
